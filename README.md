# ⚙️ MapColonies Shared GitHub Actions

This repository contains GitHub Actions used across the MapColonies organization, developed and maintained by the **DevOps team**.

> 🧪 The workflows in this repo are for testing and validating the functionality of the actions — **not for general use** in other projects.

Each action has a dedicated folder with:
- `action.yaml` – definition of the action
- `README.md` – usage and inputs specific to the action

## 🧪 Purpose of This Repo
